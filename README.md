# Powerhouse Switchboard

Open-source API over database models made to be developer- and analyst-friendly.

## Development

We use node and npm to develop this project. Commands:
```sh
# Install all required dependencies
npm i

# Run application in development mode
npm run dev
```





### Coding Setup

To install the correct node version, we recommend that you use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). If you have `nvm` installed you can run:
```sh
nvm install
nvm use
```
to automatically use the correct node version. The version is detected from the [.nvmrc](./.nvmrc).

If you do not have a code editor setup, we recommend that you use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to get started. It is very beginner friendly and you can move on to something else (such as Sublime, vim, emacs, ...) down the road if you want to.
